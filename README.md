# voice

Voice is a platform for people to have discussions about any topic worth debating.

Voice tries to solve two problems:

1. People are having the same debates about the same topics across time and space. There's no need for you to come up with your own logic to try to convince someone else about a topic. Chances are, someone already made the same argument.

2. People have debates all the time about many things, but there is never social consensus. If there was a system for communities of every size to reach a consensus, in a way that all participants would agree with the conclusion(s), policies would be much more stable and grounded.

The technical challenges to tackling these problems are as follows:

1. There needs to be an intuitive way to search for a discussion topic or idea. If you're about to have a debate with someone, you should be able to go on Voice and search for what others have said about the issue.

2. There needs to be an intuitive UI to have discussions, filter out unsound reasoning or inaccurate claims, and display the most agreed-upon arguments, following a certain standard for a fruitful debate. It should naturally lead to community-wise consensus.
